A while ago I realized that I needed a lot more practise at writing. A few technical emails per day at work doesn’t really cut it. I figured it might be fun to write about some of the games I’ve been playing recently, and it might even come in handy when recommending games to friends.

Most of the inspiration came from [Playtest](http://playtestblog.com/), a  (sadly now defunct) blog that I’ve been following for a long time and also where I learnt about three of my favourite games — Love Letter, Morels and Agricola. I’ll write my own reviews of those three (and more!) sometime soon.

I also love sailing --  racing, crusing, working on boats, everthing -- so I might talk about that a bit. Sydney is a perfect city for enjoying sailing. A huge inspiration here is my friend Alan’s blog, [Arriba](http://blog.arribasail.com/), about his boat of the same name. I’ve been lucky enough to go sailing on Arriba a couple of times [[1]](http://blog.arribasail.com/2013/11/cruise-northeastern-kangaroo-island.html) [[2]](http://blog.arribasail.com/2014/12/cruise-kangaroo-island-north-coast.html).

More recently I've been getting into digital fabrication (particularly CNC milling and laser cutting), as well as a few years ago I re-kindled my interest in electronics, microcontrollers and FPGAs. I'm hoping to use this blog as a way to chronicle projects (and also write down stuff that I learn). I have some plans to do combined sailing+electronics and games+electronics projects too!

Even though it’s mostly me writing for no particular audience, if you’ve made it this far through the intro then I hope you find something interesting here.
