  We went to New Zealand! Short trip, but lots of fun!

![image](/img/0*jk8KJ_OEUaAG_n4S.jpg)I read [“The Big Short”](http://www.booktopia.com.au/the-big-short-michael-lewis/prod9780141043531.html) on the plane — the movie was amazing and the book was just as good. I also really enjoyed [“Flash Boys”](http://www.booktopia.com.au/flash-boys-michael-lewis/prod9780241003633.html) so will have to check out Michael Lewis’ other books.

Not much progress on projects of course.

Also, this blog has now moved to Tumblr! Now I can write posts in Markdown.
