  We arrived back from NZ first thing in the morning so the day was a bit of a write-off due to the very early start.

One of the most [interesting blogs I follow](http://danluu.com/) posted a [fantastic list](http://danluu.com/programming-blogs/) of all of the best programming blogs to read. Even better, the post had a bunch of hand-picked best-of articles. That pretty much used up the entire day — totally worth it though. I think I must have read about 60 posts, everything from signal processing to operating systems to distributed systems to language design to academic research.

The only real progress I made on projects was that I assembled the shelves!
