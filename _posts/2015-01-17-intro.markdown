  A while ago I realized that I needed a lot more practise at writing. A few technical emails per day at work doesn’t really cut it. I figured it might be fun to write about some of the games I’ve been playing recently, and it might even come in handy when recommending games to friends.  
  
Most of the inspiration came from [Playtest](http://playtestblog.com/), a blog that I’ve been following for a long time and also where I learnt about three of my favourite games — Love Letter, Morels and Agricola. I’ll write my own reviews of those three (and more!) sometime soon.  
  
I also love sailing — racing, crusing, working on boats, everthing — so I might talk about that a bit. Sydney is a perfect city for enjoying sailing. A huge inspiration here is my friend Alan’s blog, [Arriba](http://blog.arribasail.com/), about his boat of the same name. I’ve been lucky enough to go sailing on Arriba a couple of times [[1]](http://blog.arribasail.com/2013/11/cruise-northeastern-kangaroo-island.html) [[2]](http://blog.arribasail.com/2014/12/cruise-kangaroo-island-north-coast.html). And, occasionally, I combine my love of electronics with sailing, so I might write about that at some stage too.  
  
Even though it’s mostly me writing for no particular audience, if you’ve made it this far through the intro then I hope you find something interesting here.
