  Today I went sailing — practice day for the upcoming CYCA Winter Series. There’s no such thing as a bad day on the harbour and today was no exception.

{% endfigure %}OK, I didn’t actually go up the mast today — that photo is from a while ago. I did spend a bunch of time up there last weekend though. Did you know you can get seasick while up the mast? No surprises there.

The electronics on the boat are still pretty useless but they’re working at least as well as they ever have so can’t complain too much. Anyway, that’s a post for later in the week…

{% endfigure %}Today wasn’t quite as productive as I’d hoped. I was going to start on the CPU simulator but then I realized it was a good opportunity to learn Go, so instead I sat on the couch and read [“The Go Programming Language”](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) which I’ve had sitting on my shelf since it came out. It’s actually a very good book — I was very impressed how effectively the examples illustrated the various concepts as they were explained — better than most other programming books I’ve read. The language is interesting and one of the key takeaways from the book was that Go especially rewards you for learning the idiomatic way of doing any given task. All languages are like that to a certain extent, but it seems much more important in Go. It’s a bit of a shame that I didn’t take the opportunity to do any Go development while at Google and learn from the masters.
